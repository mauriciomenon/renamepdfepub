# Release v0.9 — PyPDF2 → pypdf migration

Summary
-------
This release updates the codebase to prefer the modern `pypdf` package while preserving compatibility with the older `PyPDF2` package. Files across the repository that previously imported `PyPDF2` directly were updated to use a guarded import pattern that attempts to import `pypdf` and falls back to `PyPDF2` if needed.

Why
---
`pypdf` is the current, actively maintained package name for the PyPDF project. Some environments still use the legacy `PyPDF2` package. The guarded import keeps runtime behaviour unchanged while allowing environments with `pypdf` installed to use it.

What changed
------------
- Files updated (non-legacy):
  - `renomeia_livro_renew_v5.py`
  - `renomeia_livro_renew_v4.py`
  - `renomeia_livro_renew_v3.py`
  - `renomeia_livro_renew_v2.py`
  - `renomeia_livro_renew.py`
  - `RenameBook.py`
  - `pdf2txt.py`
  - `teste_apagar.py`

- Pattern applied in each updated file (conceptual):

  try:
      import pypdf as PyPDF2
  except Exception:
      try:
          import PyPDF2
      except Exception:
          PyPDF2 = None

Validation performed
--------------------
- Test suite: `pytest` — 8 passed locally in the development environment.
- Quick lint check: `flake8` still reports many style issues across the repository (long lines, unused imports, redefinition warnings, etc.). These are pre-existing or unrelated to the import change and will be addressed in a follow-up cleanup PR.

Notes & follow-ups
------------------
- This change only updates import statements and preserves runtime usage (code still calls `PyPDF2.PdfReader`, which will work with either `pypdf` or `PyPDF2`).
- Large linter cleanup (flake8) is intentionally deferred because it touches many unrelated style problems and legacy scripts.
- If you want, I can: (a) run flake8 and fix critical issues, (b) move experimental/old scripts into `legacy/` to reduce noise, or (c) split the migration into smaller commits per module.

How to reproduce locally
------------------------
1. Activate your virtualenv and run tests:
   source .venv_project/bin/activate
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest -q -r a

2. Run flake8 (expect many warnings unless you clean up or exclude legacy files):
   flake8 --max-line-length=120 .
